ImageViewer:
---Has an image viewing area and a nice layout
---The widgets in the layout have signals and slots
---The slots include, viewing the image
---the signals include push buttons for: next, previous
---There's a filebrowsing menu that lists all the image files in that directory

Seperately there's a file downloader that writes files to disk, by reading the incoming global data file
It keeps reading the incoming for changes, and once it's buffered a certain length, writes them to file
